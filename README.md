ATM Service – Spring Boot + JUnit + Mockito + GitHub Actions
This project is a small but well‑structured Spring Boot application that simulates an ATM system.
It demonstrates clean service‑layer logic, custom exception handling, component‑based design, and professional unit testing using JUnit 5 and Mockito.
A full CI pipeline using GitHub Actions and Playwright is also included.
This project is ideal for showcasing backend engineering, testing practices, and CI/CD skills.
